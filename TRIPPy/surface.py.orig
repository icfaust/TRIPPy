class Surf(geometry.Origin):
    """Surf object with inherent cartesian backend mathematics.
     
    Creates a new Surf instance which can be set to a default 
    coordinate system of cartesian or cylindrical coordinates.
    All vector mathematics are accomplished in cartesian to 
    simplify computation effort. Cylindrical vectors are
    converted at last step for return.
    
    A surface is defined by a point and two vectors. The two 
    vectors being: 1st the normal to the surface, principal axis,
    z-vector or the (0,0,1) vector of the new system defined in
    the reference system. The second vector along with the 
    first fully defines meridonial ray paths, y-vector or the
    (0,1,0) vector (.meri). The sagittal ray path, x-vector or
    the (1,0,0) is defined through a cross product (.sagi).
    Center position and rotation matricies are stored at
    instantiation.

    These conventions of norm to z, meri to y axis and sagi to
    x axis are exactly as perscribed in the OSLO optical code,
    allowing for easier translation from its data into Toroidal
    systems.

    The surface cross-sectional area is specified and used to modify
    the sagittal and meridonial vectors. This is stored as lengths 
    of the two vectors, meri and sagi. This object assumes that the 
    surface is purely normal to the input norm vector across the
    entire surface.
           
    If the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are specified following
    the eulerian rotation formalism, it is processed in the 
    following manner: alpha is the rotation from the principal
    axis in the meridonial plane, beta is the rotation about the
    plane normal to the meridonial ray, or 2nd specified vector,
    and gamma is the 2nd rotation about the principal axis. 
    This might change based on what is most physically intuitive.
    These are converted to vectors and stored as attributes.

            cartesian if False, or cylindrical if True.

        area: 2-element tuple of scipy-arrays or values.
            This sets the cross-sectional area of the view, which
            follows the convenction [sagi,meri]. Meri is the length
            in the direction of the optical axis, and sagi is the 
            length in the off axis of the optical and normal axes.
            Values are in meters.

        vec: Tuple of two Vec objects
            The two vectors describe the normal (or z) axis and
            the meridonial (or y) axis. Inputs should follow
            [meri,normal]. If not specified, it assumed that angle
            is specified.

        angle: tuple or array of 3 floats
            alpha, beta and gamma are eulerian rotation angles which
            describe the rotation and thus the sagittal and 
            meridonial rays.
